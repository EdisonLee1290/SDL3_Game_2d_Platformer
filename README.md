# SDL3 2D Platformer (Learning Project)

This project is a small 2D platformer built using SDL3 and C++.  
The main purpose of this project is to begin learning the fundamentals of **game programming**, including:

- Rendering sprites
- Game loops
- Input handling
- Tile-based collision
- Basic animation
- State management

## 🎯 Goal of the Project

The goal was not to create a polished commercial game, but rather to:

- Understand how 2D games are structured internally
- Practice using the SDL3 library
- Get comfortable with real-time programming concepts
- Experiment with graphics, timing, and gameplay logic

This project serves as a foundation for expanding into more complex game features in the future.

## 📚 Tutorial Reference

This project was based on the tutorial:

> **Tutorial:** [(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu2g-N5Z78Y&t=388s)]  
> **Author:** constref

The tutorial provided an excellent starting point and helped guide the core structure of the game.  
From there, I modified and experimented with the code to deepen my understanding.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Language:** C++
- **Framework:** SDL3
- **Build System:** CMake
- **Platform:** Windows (Visual Studio)

## 🚧 Status

This project is still a work in progress and may not be fully feature complete.  
Expect bugs, placeholder art, and temporary logic — that’s part of the learning process 😊

## 💡 Future Goals

Some of the improvements and features I would like to explore include:

- Improved entity system
- Player abilities
- Sound effects and music
- Better platforming physics
- Level loading
- Menu / UI system
